# Stabilization-of-an-Inverted-Pendulum-on-a-Cart-Using-LQR-Algorithm

In this project, we have balanaced an inverted pendulum using LQR algorithm.We also examined the stability under disturbance.Finally we run a motor circuit using the ouput from the controller (details procedure and algorithm are in the pdf report)

**Things we tried did not work**
1.The rpm of the motor circuit does not chnage its rotational direction.
